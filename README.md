# MobMorphSkinPack
A 4D skin pack for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition that lets you turn your character into a CRAZY LARGE variety of mobs!

Getting the skin pack in-game requires the following:

IOBit Unlocker: https://www.iobit.com/en/iobit-unlocker.php
LOADINGBYPASS.mcpack file: https://www.mediafire.com/file/t68g3j1k6mgppip/LOADINGBYPASS.mcpack/file
The skin pack itself: https://github.com/Humii5592/MobMorphSkinPack/releases/download/skinpack/MobMorphSkinPack.zip

Now extract the skin pack and there should be a folder called "persona". Now open the program IObit Unlocker and drag and drop the persona folder onto it. There should be a little arrow next to the big "Unlock" button. A list of options will appear. Click "Unlock & Copy" and copy the folder to this directory:

C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP\data\skin_packs

Now close IObit and open Minecraft. Once the game has loaded, double click the LOADINGBYPASS.mcpack file you previously downloaded. If it has an error, that should be fine and the skin pack should load where skin packs usually appear.

Hope you enjoy!
