    <h1>Mob Morph Skin Pack</h1>
    <p>A 4D skin pack for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition that lets you morph into a CRAZY LARGE variety of mobs! These are instructions on how to import the skin pack into Minecraft! Getting the skin pack in-game requires the following:</p>
    <a href="https://www.iobit.com/en/iobit-unlocker.php">IOBit Unlocker</a>
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/t68g3j1k6mgppip/LOADINGBYPASS.mcpack/file">LOADINGBYPASS.mcpack file</a>
    <br>
    <a href="https://github.com/Humii5592/MobMorphSkinPack/releases/download/skinpack/MobMorphSkinPack.zip">The skin pack itself</a>
    <p>Now extract the skin pack and there should be a folder called "persona". Now open the program IObit Unlocker and drag and drop the persona folder onto it. There should be a little arrow next to the big "Unlock" button. A list of options will appear. Click "Unlock & Copy" and copy the folder to this directory:</p>
    <p>C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP\data\skin_packs</p>
    <p>Now close IObit and open Minecraft. Once the game has loaded, double click the LOADINGBYPASS.mcpack file you previously downloaded. If it has an error, that should be fine and the skin pack should load where skin packs usually appear.</p>
    <p>Hope you enjoy!</p>
